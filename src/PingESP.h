/*
  PingESP.h - Utility class for pining the default gateway from ESP8266,
  some routers aren't able to detect connected devices if there is no traffic over the internet or direct to the gateway.
  This is helpful as a stay alive class, useful for not triggering security features on routers.
  Usage:
    - add the following declaration in your application header file:
        #include "PingESP.h"
        PingESP pingESP;
    - use `pingESP.ping(WiFi.gatewayIP());` in your application code
